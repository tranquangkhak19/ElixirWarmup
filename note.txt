Updating value in map
- Map.put(map, key, value)
- %{ map | key : value }

Keyword list = list contain tuples
- List are like arrays, and they could be used for any arbitrary length
- Tuples are like arrays where each index has some special meaning to us
- ex: colors = [{:primary, "red"}, {:secondary, "green"}]
- we can ignore {}
- different with map: keyword list can have duplicate key
